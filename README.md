## Project Overview

You can find it deployed here on [Test Flight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/8dgyclIS).

PUSH is a pushup tracking and sharing app. It uses the phones camera to track your pushups, it displays your statistics, and charts your activity in a GitHub style graph. You can also follow friends and monitor their stats.
